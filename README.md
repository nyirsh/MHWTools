# Monster Hunter World Tools
If you came here looking for the actual website, I'm sorry to tell you I actually shut it down. The game released a new expansion that changed things up a lot and it became very difficult to update this app to be useful again without rewriting it from scratch.
Plus, HoneyHunters became a much more popular and widespread website that achieved the exact same things this one did so... there was no reason to keep this outdated tool up and running. 

### What is MHW Tools?
MHWTools is a website made made with one goal in mind: help players making and optimizing their armor sets. Are you trying to squeeze an extra skill point into your armor set? We got that. You are unsure which weapon/armor set is gonna deal more damage? There's a functionality for that too! If you are looking into pushing your Monster Hunter World experience to the max, then you landed on the right website.

### That's cool, how do I use those tools?
Just browse the website and fiddle around! You'll find out that if you have even just a little experience with the game it's actually pretty straightforward, if you're confused about what you're looking at, then this website is not for you... yet, go and enjoy the game and come back here later.
Before you start looking for that op armor combo, make sure you have set the right amount of decorations you own under the `Settings` tab and don't forget you can also ask the tool to use, or not use, specific armor pieces by either pinning or excluding them.

### I found a bug
I'm a human therefore I can make mistakes too. But I can fix them.
Please use [this form](https://github.com/nyirsh/MHWTools/issues) to report and explain what the bug is all about. Please be as specific as possible, attach screenshots/evidences if you have any and just try to answer to these simple questions:

```
- Which tab where you using?
- Which language were you using?
- What is the error about?
- Can you replicate the error? If so, which steps do I have to follow?
```

### Cool project! Can I help out?
Sure thing! Suggesting new ideas is a way of helping but if you want to get involved into this project into a more deep way, I'm always looking for translators and javascript developers. Please contact me for further details.

I don't like asking for money, reason why you won't find this button on the website itself but if you found this tool useful and you wish to say thanks just... buy me a coffee! I'll be infinitevily grateful to you and I'll convert all of that caffeine into more code!
